# Skydive-App
Lets you know if the current weather conditions allow you to skydive safely.
You are prompted to select a state and the nearest city to your dropzone. The app then
contacts the wunderground.com api to check that windspeed and windgusts are under 23mph.
If the windspeed or gusts are higher than 23mph you are prompted to stay on the ground.
If the windspeed and gusts are lower than 23mph you are cleared to jump :)
